with cte as (
    select users.id, count(comments.user_id ) as comment_count
    from users left join comments  on users.id = comments.user_id
    and comments.created_at between '2020-01-01' AND '2020-01-31'

from cte
group by 1

    u.id,
    username,
    sum(case when is_upvote then 1 else 0 end) as upvotes
from comments c 
join users u on c.user_id = u.id
join comment_votes cv on c.id = cv.comment_id

where extract(year from c.created_at) = 2020
and not c.is_deleted
and c.user_id != cv.user_id

group by 1, 2

order by 3 desc
limit 3

4) Project Pairs

select 	
pe.end_date as date ,
pe.title as project_title_end,
